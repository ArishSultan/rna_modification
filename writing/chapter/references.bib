	abstract = {Pseudouridine is an RNA modification that is widely distributed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and plays a critical role in numerous biological activities. Despite its importance, the precise identification of pseudouridine sites through experimental approaches poses significant challenges, requiring substantial time and resources.Therefore, there is a growing need for computational techniques that can reliably and quickly identify pseudouridine sites from vast amounts of RNA sequencing data. In this study, we propose fuzzy kernel evidence Random Forest (FKeERF) to identify pseudouridine sites. This method is called PseU-FKeERF, which demonstrates high accuracy in identifying pseudouridine sites from RNA sequencing data. The PseU-FKeERF model selected four RNA feature coding schemes with relatively good performance for feature combination, and then input them into the newly proposed FKeERF method for category prediction. FKeERF not only uses fuzzy logic to expand the original feature space, but also combines kernel methods that are easy to interpret in general for category prediction. Both cross-validation tests and independent tests on benchmark datasets have shown that PseU-FKeERF has better predictive performance than several state-of-the-art methods. This new method not only improves the accuracy of pseudouridine site identification, but also provides a certain reference for disease control and related drug development in the future.},

	abstract = {RNA pseudouridine modification exists in different RNA types of many species, and it has a significant role in regulating the expression of biological processes. To understand the functional mechanisms for RNA pseudouridine sites, the accurate identification of pseudouridine sites in RNA sequences is essential. Although several fast and inexpensive computational methods have been proposed, the challenge of improving recognition accuracy and generalization still exists. This study proposed a novel ensemble predictor called PseUpred-ELPSO for improved RNA pseudouridine site prediction. After analyzing the nucleotide composition preferences between RNA pseudouridine site sequences, two feature representations were determined and fed into the stacking ensemble framework. Then, using five tree-based machine learning classifiers as base classifiers, 30-dimensional RNA profiles are constructed to represent RNA sequences, and using the PSO algorithm, the weights of the RNA profiles were searched to further enhance the representation. A logistic regression classifier was used as a meta-classifier to complete the final predictions. Compared to the most advanced predictors, the performance of PseUpred-ELPSO is superior in both cross-validation and the independent test. Based on the PseUpred-ELPSO predictor, a free and easy-to-operate web server has been established, which will be a powerful tool for pseudouridine site identification.},

	abstract = {RNA protein Interactions (RPIs) play an important role in biological systems. Recently, we have enumerated the RPIs at residue level and have elucidated the minimum structural unit (MSU) in these interactions to be a stretch of five residues (Nucleotides/amino acids). Pseudouridine is the most frequent modification in RNA. The conversion of uridine to pseudouridine involves interactions between pseudourdine synthase and RNA. The existing models to predict the pseudouridine sites in a given RNA sequence mainly depend on user defined features such as mono and dinucleotide composition/propensities of RNA sequences. Predicting pseudouridine sites is a non-linear classification problem with limited data points. Deep Learning models are efficient discriminators when the data set size is reasonably large and fails when there is paucity in data ({\textless} 1000 samples). To mitigate this problem, we propose a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Kernel based on utility theory from Economics, and using data driven parameters (i.e. MSU) as features. For this purpose, we have used position-specific tri/quad/pentanucleotide composition/propensity (PSPC/PSPP) besides nucleotide and dineculeotide composition as features. SVMs are known to work well in small data regime and kernels in SVM are designed to classify non-linear data. The proposed model outperforms the existing state of the art models significantly (10\% − 15\% on average).},

	abstract = {Pseudouridine (ψ) is reported to occur frequently in all types of RNA. This uridine modification has been shown to be essential for processes such as RNA stability and stress response. Also, it is linked to a few human diseases, such as prostate cancer, anemia, etc. A few laboratory techniques, such as Pseudo-seq and N3-CMC-enriched Pseudouridine sequencing (CeU-Seq) are used for detecting ψ sites. However, these are laborious and drawnout methods. The convenience of sequencing data has enabled the development of computationally intelligent models for improving ψ site identification methods. The proposed work provides a prediction model for the identification of ψ sites through popular ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting. Features were obtained through a novel feature extraction mechanism with the assimilation of statistical moments, which were used to train ensemble models. The cross-validation test and independent set test were used to evaluate the precision of the trained models. The proposed model outperformed the preexisting predictors and revealed 87\% accuracy, 0.90 specificity, 0.85 sensitivity, and a 0.75 Matthews correlation coefficient.

	abstract = {Background: Pseudouridine (Ψ) is one of the most abundant RNA modiﬁcations found in a variety of RNA types, and it plays a signiﬁcant role in many biological processes. The key to studying the various biochemical functions and mechanisms of Ψ is to identify the Ψ sites. However, identifying Ψ sites using experimental methods is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods that can accurately predict Ψ sites based on RNA sequence information.
Methods: In this study, we proposed a new model called PseU-ST to identify Ψ sites in Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and Mus musculus (M. musculus). We selected the best six encoding schemes and four machine learning algorithms based on a comprehensive test of almost all of the RNA sequence encoding schemes available in the iLearnPlus software package, and selected the optimal features for each encoding scheme using chi-square and incremental feature selection algorithms. Then, we selected the optimal feature combination and the best base-classiﬁer combination for each species through an extensive performance comparison and employed a stacking strategy to build the predictive model.
Results: The results demonstrated that PseU-ST achieved better prediction performance compared with other existing models. The PseU-ST accuracy scores were 93.64\%, 87.74\%, and 89.64\% on H\_990, S\_628, and M\_944, respectively, representing increments of 13.94\%, 6.05\%, and 0.26\%, respectively, higher than the best existing methods on the same benchmark training datasets.
Conclusion: The data indicate that PseU-ST is a very competitive prediction model for identifying RNA Ψ sites in H. sapiens, M. musculus, and S. cerevisiae. In addition, we found that the Position-speciﬁc trinucleotide propensity based on single strand (PSTNPss) and Position-speciﬁc of three nucleotides (PS3) features play an important role in Ψ site identiﬁcation. The source code for PseU-ST and the data are obtainable in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/jluzhangxinrubio/PseU-ST).},

The identiﬁcation of Ψ modiﬁcation sites is of great signiﬁcance for disease mechanism and biological processes research in which machine learning algorithms are desirable as the lab exploratory techniques are expensive and time-consuming.
Results: In this work, we propose a deep learning framework, called PseUdeep, to identify Ψ sites of three species: H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, and M. musculus. In this method, three encoding methods are used to extract the features of RNA sequences, that is, one-hot encoding, K-tuple nucleotide frequency pattern, and position-speciﬁc nucleotide composition. The three feature matrices are convoluted twice and fed into the capsule neural network and bidirectional gated recurrent unit network with a self-attention mechanism for classiﬁcation.
Conclusion: Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our model gets the highest accuracy of the prediction on the independent testing data set S-200; the accuracy improves 12.38\%, and on the independent testing data set H-200, the accuracy improves 0.68\%. Moreover, the dimensions of the features we derive from the RNA sequences are only 109,109, and 119 in H. sapiens, M. musculus, and S. cerevisiae, which is much smaller than those used in the traditional algorithms. On evaluation via tenfold crossvalidation and two independent testing data sets, PseUdeep outperforms the best traditional machine learning model available.

Although some computational methods have been proposed for the identiﬁcation of pseudouridine sites, it is still a challenge to improve the identiﬁcation accuracy and generalization ability. To address this challenge, a novel feature fusion predictor, named PsoEL-PseU, is proposed for the prediction of pseudouridine sites. Firstly, this study systematically and comprehensively explored different types of feature descriptors and determined six feature descriptors with various properties. To improve the feature representation ability, a binary particle swarm optimizer was used to capture the optimal feature subset for six feature descriptors. Secondly, six individual predictors were trained by using the six optimal feature subsets. Finally, to fuse the effects of all six features, six individual predictors were fused into an ensemble predictor by a parallel fusion strategy. Ten-fold cross-validation on three benchmark datasets indicated that the PsoEL-PseU predictor signiﬁcantly outperformed the current state-of-the-art predictors. Additionally, the new predictor achieved better accuracy in the independent dataset evaluation—accuracy which is signiﬁcantly higher than that of its existing counterparts—and the user-friendly webserver developed by the PsoEL-PseU predictor has been made freely accessible.},

Almost all kinds of RNAs are subject to this modification. However, it remains a great challenge to identify pseudouridine sites via experimental approaches, requiring expensive and time-consuming experimental research. Therefore, computational approaches that can be used to perform accurate in silico identification of pseudouridine sites from the large amount of RNA sequence data are highly desirable and can aid in the functional elucidation of this critical modification. Here, we propose a new computational approach, termed Porpoise, to accurately identify pseudouridine sites from RNA sequence data. Porpoise builds upon a comprehensive evaluation of 18 frequently used feature encoding schemes based on the selection of four types of features, including binary features, pseudo k-tuple composition, nucleotide chemical property and position-specific trinucleotide propensity based on single-strand (PSTNPss). The selected features are fed into the stacked ensemble learning framework to enable the construction of an effective stacked model. Both cross-validation tests on the benchmark dataset and independent tests show that Porpoise achieves superior predictive performance than several state-of-the-art approaches. The application of model interpretation tools demonstrates the importance of PSTNPs for the performance of the trained models. This new method is anticipated to facilitate community-wide efforts to identify putative pseudouridine sites and formulate novel testable biological hypothesis.},

Using the power of deep learning and raw sequence, as well as secondary structure features, our tool MU-PseUDeep is designed to capture both the sequence and secondary structure context, which inputs the raw RNA sequence and the predicted secondary structure to two sets of convolutional neural networks. It has shown considerable improvement in W site prediction over existing tools, XG-PseU, PseUI, and iRNA-PseU for both balanced and imbalanced datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate tool for W site prediction.

	abstract = {One of the ubiquitous chemical modiﬁcations in RNA, pseudouridine modiﬁcation is crucial for various cellular biological and physiological processes. To gain more insight into the functional mechanisms involved, it is of fundamental importance to precisely identify pseudouridine sites in RNA. Several useful machine learning approaches have become available recently, with the increasing progress of next-generation sequencing technology; however, existing methods cannot predict sites with high accuracy. Thus, a more accurate predictor is required. In this study, a random forest-based predictor named RF-PseU is proposed for prediction of pseudouridylation sites. To optimize feature representation and obtain a better model, the light gradient boosting machine algorithm and incremental feature selection strategy were used to select the optimum feature space vector for training the random forest model RF-PseU. Compared with previous state-of-the-art predictors, the results on the same benchmark data sets of three species demonstrate that RF-PseU performs better overall. The integrated average leave-one-out cross-validation and independent testing accuracy scores were 71.4\% and 74.7\%, respectively, representing increments of 3.63\% and 4.77\% versus the best existing predictor. Moreover, the ﬁnal RF-PseU model for prediction was built on leave-one-out cross-validation and provides a reliable and robust tool for identifying pseudouridine sites.

With the increasing availability of genomic and proteomic samples, computer-aided pseudouridine-synthase-specific Ψ site recognition is becoming possible. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach to identify pseudouridine sites, named EnsemPseU. First, five sequenceencoding strategies, namely, kmer, binary encoding, enhanced nucleic acid composition (ENAC), nucleotide chemical property (NCP), and nucleotide density (ND), were applied to extract sequence information. Then, chi-square feature selection was used to reduce the feature dimensionality and remove redundant information. Finally, an ensemble algorithm integrating support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), naïve Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) was used to build our prediction model. Upon testing, the results showed that the accuracy improved 5.3\% for H. sapiens, 6.09\% for S. cerevisiae, and 5.55\% for M. musculus after chi-square feature selection. Moreover, upon evaluation via 10-fold cross-validation and an independent test, our proposed model EnsemPseU outperformed the other best existing model.

	abstract = {Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the first discovered and the most prevalent posttranscriptional modification, which has been widely studied during the past decades. Pseudouridine was observed in almost all kinds of RNAs and shown to have important biological functions. Currently, the time-consuming and high-cost procedures of experimental approaches limit its uses in real-life Ψ site detection. Alternatively, by taking advantage of the explosive growth of Ψ sequencing data, the computational methods may provide a more cost-effective avenue. To date, the existing mouse Ψ site predictors were all developed based on sequence-derived features, and their performance can be further improved by adding the domain knowledge derived feature. Therefore, it is highly desirable to propose a genomic feature-based computational method to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the identification of Ψ RNA modification in the mouse transcriptome. In our study, a predictive framework PSI-MOUSE was built. Besides the conventional sequence-based features, PSI-MOUSE first introduced 38 additional genomic features derived from the mouse genome, which achieved a satisfactory improvement in the prediction performance, compared with other existing models. Moreover, PSI-MOUSE also features in automatically annotating the putative Ψ sites with diverse types of posttranscriptional regulations (RNAbinding protein [RBP]-binding regions, miRNA-RNA interactions, and splicing sites), which can serve as a useful research tool for the study of Ψ RNA modification in the mouse genome. Finally, 3282 experimentally validated mouse Ψ sites were also collected in a database with customized query functions. For the convenience of academic users, a website was built to provide a user-friendly interface for the query and analysis on the database. The website is freely accessible at www.xjtlu.edu.cn/biologicalsciences/psimouse and http://psimouse.rnamd.com. We introduced the genome-derived features to mouse for the first time, and we achieved a good performance in mouse Ψ site prediction. Compared with the existing state-of-art methods, our newly developed approach PSI-MOUSE obtained a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy, marking the reliable contributions of genomic features for the prediction of RNA modifications in a species other than human.},

The identification of pseudouridine sites is an essential step toward understanding RNA functions, RNA structure stabilization, translation process, and RNA stability; however, high-throughput experimental techniques remain expensive and time-consuming in lab explorations and biochemical processes. Thus, how to develop an efficient pseudouridine site identification method based on machine learning is very important both in academic research and drug development. Motived by this, we present an effective layered ensemble model designated as iPseU-Layer for identification of RNA pseudouridine sites. The proposed iPseU-Layer approach is essentially based on three different machine learning layers including: feature selection layer, feature extraction and fusion layer, and prediction layer. The feature selection layer reduces the dimensionality, which can be regarded as a data pre-processing stage. The feature extraction and fusion layer utilizes an ensemble method which is implemented through various machine learning algorithms to generate some outputs. The prediction layer applies classic random forest to identify the final results. Furthermore, we systematically conduct the validation experiments using cross-validation tests and independent test with the current state-of-the-art models. The proposed iPseU-Layer provides a promising predictive performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Collectively, these findings indicate that the framework of iPseU-Layer is a feasible and effective strategy for the prediction of RNA pseudouridine sites.},

	abstract = {Background: Pseudouridine modification is most commonly found among various kinds of RNA modification occurred in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This biochemical event has been proved to occur in multiple types of RNAs, including rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and nuclear/nucleolar RNA. Hence, gaining a holistic understanding of pseudouridine modification can contribute to the development of drug discovery and gene therapies. Although some laboratory techniques have come up with moderately good outcomes in pseudouridine identification, they are costly and required skilled work experience. We propose iPseU-NCP – an efficient computational framework to predict pseudouridine sites using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm combined with nucleotide chemical properties (NCP) generated from RNA sequences. The benchmark dataset collected from Chen et al. (2016) was used to develop iPseU-NCP and fairly compare its performances with other methods.
Results: Under the same experimental settings, comparing with three state-of-the-art methods including iPseU-CNN, PseUI, and iRNA-PseU, the Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) of our model increased by about 20.0\%, 55.0\%, and 109.0\% when tested on the H. sapiens (H\_200) dataset and by about 6.5\%, 35.0\%, and 150.0\% when tested on the S. cerevisiae (S\_200) dataset, respectively. This significant growth in MCC is very important since it ensures the stability and performance of our model. With those two independent test datasets, our model also presented higher accuracy with a success rate boosted by 7.0\%, 13.0\%, and 20.0\% and 2.0\%, 9.5\%, and 25.0\% when compared to iPseU-CNN, PseUI, and iRNA-PseU, respectively. For majority of other evaluation metrics, iPseU-NCP demonstrated superior performance as well.
Conclusions: iPseU-NCP combining the RF and NPC-encoded features showed better performances than other existing state-of-the-art methods in the identification of pseudouridine sites. This also shows an optimistic view in addressing biological issues related to human diseases.},

Although existing tools can predict m6A at single-base resolution, it is still challenging to extract the biological information surrounding m6A sites. Results: We implemented a deep learning framework, named DeepM6ASeq, to predict m6A-containing sequences and characterize surrounding biological features based on miCLIP-Seq data, which detects m6A sites at single-base resolution. DeepM6ASeq showed better performance as compared to other machine learning classifiers. Moreover, an independent test on m6A-Seq data, which identifies m6A-containing genomic regions, revealed that our model is competitive in predicting m6A-containing sequences. The learned motifs from DeepM6ASeq correspond to known m6A readers. Notably, DeepM6ASeq also identifies a newly recognized m6A reader: FMR1. Besides, we found that a saliency map in the deep learning model could be utilized to visualize locations of m6A sites.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m6A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m6A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks.

Thus, accurate identification of pseudouridine (Ψ) sites in RNA will be of great benefit for understanding these cellular processes. Due to the low efficiency and high cost of current available experimental methods, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods for accurately and efficiently detecting Ψ sites in RNA sequences. However, the predictive accuracy of existing computational methods is not satisfactory and still needs improvement.
Results: In this study, we developed a new model, PseUI, for Ψ sites identification in three species, which are H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, and M. musculus. Firstly, five different kinds of features including nucleotide composition (NC), dinucleotide composition (DC), pseudo dinucleotide composition (pseDNC), position-specific nucleotide propensity (PSNP), and position-specific dinucleotide propensity (PSDP) were generated based on RNA segments. Then, a sequential forward feature selection strategy was used to gain an effective feature subset with a compact representation but discriminative prediction power. Based on the selected feature subsets, we built our model by using a support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the generalization of our model was validated by both the jackknife test and independent validation tests on the benchmark datasets. The experimental results showed that our model is more accurate and stable than the previously published models.

	abstract = {Catalyzed by adenosine deaminase (ADAR), the adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing in RNA is not only involved in various important biological processes, but also closely associated with a series of major diseases. Therefore, knowledge about the A-to-I editing sites in RNA is crucially important for both basic research and drug development. Given an uncharacterized RNA sequence that contains many adenosine (A) residues, can we identify which one of them can be of A-to-I editing, and which one cannot? Unfortunately, so far no computational method whatsoever has been developed to address such an important problem based on the RNA sequence information alone. To fill this empty area, we have proposed a predictor called iRNA-AI by incorporating the chemical properties of nucleotides and their sliding occurrence density distribution along a RNA sequence into the general form of pseudo nucleotide composition (PseKNC). It has been shown by the rigorous jackknife test and independent dataset test that the performance of the proposed predictor is quite promising. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly webserver for iRNA-AI has been established at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iRNA-AI/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.},

	abstract = {Occurring at adenine (A) with the consensus motif GAC, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant modifications in RNA, which plays very important roles in many biological processes. The non-uniform distribution of m6A sites across the genome implies that, for better understanding the regulatory mechanism of m6A, it is indispensable to characterize its sites in a genome-wide scope. Although a series of experimental technologies have been developed in this regard, they are both time-consuming and expensive. With the avalanche of RNA sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational method to timely identify their m6A sites. In view of this, a predictor called “iRNA-Methyl” was proposed by formulating RNA sequences with the “pseudo dinucleotide composition”, into which three RNA physiochemical properties were incorporated. To our best knowledge, it is the first computational predictor ever established for identifying m6A sites in RNA. Rigorous cross validation tests have indicated that iRNA-Methyl holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server for iRNA-Methyl was established at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iRNA-Methyl, by which users can easily get their desired results without needing to go through the mathematical details.},

	abstract = {Post-transcriptional modification of RNA nucleosides occurs in all living organisms. Pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding RNAs1, enhances the function of transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA by stabilizing RNA structure2–8. mRNAs were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mRNA function – it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding center9,10. However, without evidence of naturally occurring mRNA pseudouridylation, its physiological was unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudouridylation in yeast and human RNAs using Pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution method for pseudouridine identification. Pseudo-seq accurately identifies known modification sites as well as 100 novel sites in non-coding RNAs, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated sites in mRNAs. Genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine synthases, Pus1–4, 6, 7 and 9. Notably, the majority of pseudouridines in mRNA are regulated in response to environmental signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum starvation in human cells. These results suggest a mechanism for the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through inducible mRNA modifications. Our findings reveal unanticipated roles for pseudouridylation and provide a resource for identifying the targets of pseudouridine synthases implicated in human disease11–13.},

	abstract = {We developed a novel technique, called pseudouridine site identification sequencing (PSI-seq), for the transcriptome-wide mapping of pseudouridylation sites with single-base resolution from cellular RNAs based on the induced termination of reverse transcription specifically at pseudouridines following CMCT treatment. PSI-seq analysis of RNA samples from S. cerevisiae correctly detected all of the 43 known pseudouridines in yeast 18S and 25S ribosomal RNA with high specificity. Moreover, application of PSI-seq to the yeast transcriptome revealed the presence of site-specific pseudouridylation within dozens of mRNAs, including RPL11a, TEF1, and other genes implicated in translation. To identify the mechanisms responsible for mRNA pseudouridylation, we genetically deleted candidate pseudouridine synthase (Pus) enzymes and reconstituted their activities in vitro. These experiments demonstrated that the Pus1 enzyme was necessary and sufficient for pseudouridylation of RPL11a mRNA, whereas Pus4 modified TEF1 mRNA, and Pus6 pseudouridylated KAR2 mRNA. Finally, we determined that modification of RPL11a at Y -68 was observed in RNA from the related yeast S. mikitae, and Y 239 in TEF1 mRNA was maintained in S. mikitae as well as S. pombe, indicating that these pseudouridylations are ancient, evolutionarily conserved RNA modifications. This work establishes that site-specific pseudouridylation of eukaryotic mRNAs is a genetically programmed RNA modification that naturally occurs in multiple yeast transcripts via distinct mechanisms, suggesting that mRNA pseudouridylation may provide an important novel regulatory function. The approach and strategies that we report here should be generally applicable to the discovery of pseudouridylation, or other RNA modifications, in diverse biological contexts.},

	abstract = {RNA post-transcriptional modifications play a crucial role in a myriad of biological processes and cellular functions. To date, more than 160 RNA modifications have been discovered; therefore, accurate identification of RNA-modification sites is fundamental for a better understanding of RNA-mediated biological functions and mechanisms. However, due to limitations in experimental methods, systematic identification of different types of RNA-modification sites remains a major challenge. Recently, more than 20 computational methods have been developed to identify RNA-modification sites in tandem with high-throughput experimental methods, with most of these capable of predicting only single types of RNA-modification sites. These methods show high diversity in their dataset size, data quality, core algorithms, features extracted and feature selection techniques and evaluation strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to revisit these methods and summarize their methodologies, in order to improve and further develop computational techniques to identify and characterize RNA-modification sites from the large amounts of sequence data. With this goal in mind, first, we provide a comprehensive survey on a large collection of 27 state-of-the-art approaches for predicting N1-methyladenosine and N6-methyladenosine sites. We cover a variety of important aspects that are crucial for the development of successful predictors, including the dataset quality, operating algorithms, sequence and genomic features, feature selection, model performance evaluation and software utility. In addition, we also provide our thoughts on potential strategies to improve the model performance. Second, we propose a computational approach called DeepPromise based on deep learning techniques for simultaneous prediction of N1-methyladenosine and N6-methyladenosine. To extract the sequence context surrounding the modification sites, three feature encodings, including enhanced nucleic acid composition, one-hot encoding, and RNA embedding, were used as the input to seven consecutive layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), respectively. Moreover, DeepPromise further combined the prediction score of the CNN-based models and achieved around 43\% higher area under receiver-operating curve (AUROC) for m1A site prediction and 2–6\% higher AUROC for m6A site prediction, respectively, when compared with several existing state-of-the-art approaches on the independent test. In-depth analyses of characteristic sequence motifs identified from the convolution-layer filters indicated that nucleotide presentation at proximal positions surrounding the modification sites contributed most to the classification, whereas those at distal positions also affected classification but to different extents. To maximize user convenience, a web server was developed as an implementation of DeepPromise and made publicly available at http://DeepPromise.erc.monash.edu/, with the server accepting both RNA sequences and genomic sequences to allow prediction of two types of putative RNA-modification sites.},

	abstract = {Pseudouridine (5-ribosyluracil ) is a ubiquitous yet enigmatic constituent of structural RNAs (transfer, ribosomal, small nuclear, and small nucleolar). Although pseudouridine (W) was the �rst modi�ed nucleoside to be discovered in RNA, and is the most abundant, its biosynthesis and biological roles have remained poorly understood since its identi�cation as a “�fth nucleoside” in RNA. Recently, a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and genetic approaches has helped to illuminate the structural consequences of W in polyribonucleotides, the biochemical mechanism of U! W isomerization in RNA, and the role of modi�cation enzymes (W synthases) and box H/ACA snoRNAs, a class of eukaryotic small nucleolar RNAs, in the site-speci�c biosynthesis of W. Through its unique ability to coordinate a structural water molecule via its free N1-H, W exerts a subtle but signi�cant “rigidifying” in�uence on the nearby sugar-phosphate backbone and also enhances base stacking. These effects may underlie the biological role of most (but perhaps not all) of the W residues in RNA. Certain genetic mutants lacking speci�c W residues in tRNA or rRNA exhibit dif�culties in translation, display slow growth rates, and fail to compete effectively with wild-type strains in mixed culture. In particular, normal growth is severely compromised in an Escherichia coli mutant de�cient in a pseudouridine synthase responsible for the formation of three closely spaced W residues in the mRNA decoding region of the 23S rRNA. Such studies demonstrate that pseudouridylation of RNA confers an important selective advantage in a natural biological context.},

            Although over 170 chemical modifications have been identified, their prevalence, mechanism and function remain largely unknown. To enable integrated analysis of diverse RNA modification profiles, we have developed RMBase v3.0 (http://bioinformaticsscience.cn/rmbase/), a comprehensive platform consisting of eight modules. These modules facilitate the exploration of transcriptome-wide landscape, biogenesis, interactome and functions of RNA modifications. By mining thousands of epitranscriptome datasets with novel pipelines, the ‘RNA Modifications’ module reveals the map of 73 RNA modifications of 62 species. the ‘Genes’ module allows to retrieve RNA modification profiles and clusters by gene and transcript. The ‘Mechanisms’ module explores 23 382 enzyme-catalyzed or snoRNA-guided modified sites to elucidate their biogenesis mechanisms. The ‘Co-localization’ module systematically formulates potential correlations between 14 histone modifications and 6 RNA modifications in various cell-lines. The ‘RMP’ module investigates the differential expression profiles of 146 RNA-modifying proteins (RMPs) in 18 types of cancers. The ‘Interactome’ integrates the interactional relationships between 73 RNA modifications with RBP binding events, miRNA targets and SNPs. The ‘Motif’ illuminates the enriched motifs for 11 types of RNA modifications identified from epitranscriptome datasets. The ‘Tools’ introduces a novel web-based ‘modGeneTool’ for annotating modifications. Overall, RMBase v3.0 provides various resources and tools for studying RNA modifications.},

            Summary: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

Compared with the classical sequence‐based methods, the pseudo nucleotide composition or PseKNC approach developed very recently has the following advantages: (1) it can convert length‐different DNA/RNA sequences into dimension‐fixed digital vectors that can be directly handled by all the existing machine‐learning algorithms or operation engines; (2) it can contain the desired features and properties according to the selection or definition of users; (3) it can cover considerable sequence pattern information, both local and global.

            Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the most prevalent post-transcriptional RNA modification and is widespread in small cellular RNAs and mRNAs. However, the functions, mechanisms, and precise distribution of Ψs (especially in mRNAs) still remain largely unclear. The landscape of Ψs across the transcriptome has not yet been fully delineated. Here, we present a highly effective model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), called PseudoUridyLation Site Estimator (PULSE), to analyze large-scale profiling data of Ψ sites and characterize the contextual sequence features of pseudouridylation. PULSE, consisting of two alternatively-stacked convolution and pooling layers followed by a fully-connected neural network, can automatically learn the hidden patterns of pseudouridylation from the local sequence information. Extensive validation tests demonstrated that PULSE can outperform other state-of-the-art prediction methods and achieve high prediction accuracy, thus enabling us to further characterize the transcriptome-wide landscape of Ψ sites. We further showed that the prediction results derived from PULSE can provide novel insights into understanding the functional roles of pseudouridylation, such as the regulations of RNA secondary structure, codon usage, translation, and RNA stability, and the connection to single nucleotide variants. The source code and final model for PULSE are available at https://github.com/mlcb-thu/PULSE.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Motivation: With protein sequences entering into databanks at an explosive pace, the early determination of the family or subfamily class for a newly found enzyme molecule becomes important because this is directly related to the detailed information about which specific target it acts on, as well as to its catalytic process and biological function. Unfortunately, it is both time-consuming and costly to do so by experiments alone. In a previous study, the covariant-discriminant algorithm was introduced to identify the 16 subfamily classes of oxidoreductases. Although the results were quite encouraging, the entire prediction process was based on the amino acid composition alone without including any sequence-order information. Therefore, it is worthy of further investigation.
            Results: To incorporate the sequence-order effects into the predictor, the ‘amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition’ is introduced to represent the statistical sample of a protein. The novel representation contains 20 + 2λ discrete numbers: the first 20 numbers are the components of the conventional amino acid composition; the next 2λ numbers are a set of correlation factors that reflect different hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity distribution patterns along a protein chain. Based on such a concept and formulation scheme, a new predictor is developed. It is shown by the self-consistency test, jackknife test and independent dataset tests that the success rates obtained by the new predictor are all significantly higher than those by the previous predictors. The significant enhancement in success rates also implies that the distribution of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the amino acid residues along a protein chain plays a very important role to its structure and function.

            We provide a unified overview of methods that currently are widely used to assess the accuracy of prediction algorithms, from raw percentages, quadratic error measures and other distances, and correlation coefficients, and to information theoretic measures such as relative entropy and mutual information. We briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. For classification tasks, we derive new learning algorithms for the design of prediction systems by directly optimising the correlation coefficient. We observe and prove several results relating sensitivity and specificity of optimal systems. While the principles are general, we illustrate the applicability on specific problems such as protein secondary structure and signal peptide prediction.

We discuss several concepts and measures that reflect the probability that prediction is informed versus chance. Informedness and introduce Markedness as a dual measure for the probability that prediction is marked versus chance.

	abstract = {Dyskerin and its homologs are ancient and conserved enzymes that catalyze the most common post-transcriptional modification found in cells, pseudouridylation. The resulting pseudouridines provide stability to RNA molecules and regulate ribosome biogenesis and splicing events. Dyskerin does not act independently—it is the core component of a protein heterotetramer, which associates with RNAs that contain the H/ACA motif. The variety of H/ACA RNAs that guide the function of this ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex highlights the diversity of cellular processes in which dyskerin participates. When associated with small nucleolar (sno) RNAs, it regulates ribosomal (r) RNAs and ribosome biogenesis. By interacting with small Cajal body (sca) RNAs, it targets small nuclear (sn) RNAs to regulate pre-mRNA splicing. As a component of the telomerase holoenzyme, dyskerin binds to the telomerase RNA to modulate telomere maintenance. In a disease context, dyskerin malfunction can result in multiple detrimental phenotypes. Mutations in
              DKC1
              , the gene that encodes dyskerin, cause the premature aging syndrome X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (X-DC), a still incurable disorder that typically leads to bone marrow failure. In this review, we present the classical and most recent findings on this essential protein, discussing the evolutionary, structural, and functional aspects of dyskerin and the H/ACA RNP. The latest research underscores the role that dyskerin plays in the regulation of gene expression, translation efficiency, and telomere maintenance, along with the impacts that defective dyskerin has on aging, cell proliferation, haematopoietic potential, and cancer.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test values, which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting patterns and correlations otherwise undetectable by medical doctors. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patients’ survival from their data and can individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records.
            
            
              Methods
              In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure collected in 2015. We apply several machine learning classifiers to both predict the patients survival, and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors. We also perform an alternative feature ranking analysis by employing traditional biostatistics tests, and compare these results with those provided by the machine learning algorithms. Since both feature ranking approaches clearly identify serum creatinine and ejection fraction as the two most relevant features, we then build the machine learning survival prediction models on these two factors alone.
            
            
              Results
              Our results of these two-feature models show not only that serum creatinine and ejection fraction are sufficient to predict survival of heart failure patients from medical records, but also that using these two features alone can lead to more accurate predictions than using the original dataset features in its entirety. We also carry out an analysis including the follow-up month of each patient: even in this case, serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the most predictive clinical features of the dataset, and are sufficient to predict patients’ survival.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This discovery has the potential to impact on clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction.},
