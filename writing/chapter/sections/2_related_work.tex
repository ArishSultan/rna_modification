  \section{Past Studies}\label{sec:past-studies}

    \subsection*{iRNA-PseU \cite{chen_irna-pseu_nodate}}\label{subsec:iRNA-PseU}
      This study employed a feature encoding scheme based on nucleotide chemical properties and nucleotide frequency.
      The chemical properties (e.g., purine/pyrimidine structure, amino/keto groups, and hydrogen bond strength) were encoded alongside nucleotide occurrence frequency.
      This aimed to capture the biological relevance of nucleotide sequences for pseudouridine site prediction.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Feature Encoding}: NCP, PseKNC
        \item \textbf{Model}: SVM with RBF kernel.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{PseUI \cite{he_pseui_2018}}\label{subsec:PseUI}
      This study combined various feature encoding schemes, including nucleotide composition (NC), dinucleotide composition (DC), pseudo dinucleotide composition (pseDNC), position-specific nucleotide propensity (PSNP), and position-specific dinucleotide propensity (PSDP). It employed sequential forward feature selection (SFS) to create a compact, discriminative feature set for pseudouridine site prediction.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Feature Encoding}: NC, DNC, PseDNC, PSNP, PSDP
        \item \textbf{Feature Selection}: SFS, evaluated with MCC
        \item \textbf{Model}: SVM, jackknife cross-validation.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{XG-PseU \cite{liu_xg-pseu_2020}}\label{subsec:XG-PseU}
      This study used multiple feature encoding schemes, such as nucleotide composition (NC), dinucleotide composition (DNC), trinucleotide composition (TNC), nucleotide chemical properties (NCP), nucleotide density (ND), and one-hot encoding.
      A two-step feature selection (forward selection and increment feature selection) was employed for optimal performance in pseudouridine site prediction.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Feature Encoding}: NC, DNC, TNC, NCP, ND, one-hot.
        \item \textbf{Feature Selection}: Forward feature selection and IFS
        \item \textbf{Model}: XGBoost, 10-fold cross-validation.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{iPseU-NCP \cite{nguyen-vo_ipseu-ncp_2019}}\label{subsec:ipseu_ncp}
      This study utilized Random Forest (RF) with nucleotide chemical property (NCP) encoding to represent the structural aspects of RNA sequences.
      Feature importance within the Random Forest model was used for feature selection.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Feature Encoding}: NCP, PseKNC, CKSNAP
        \item \textbf{Feature Selection}: Feature importance ranking in RF
        \item \textbf{Model}: RF, grid search with 5-fold cross-validation.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{PseU-FKeERF \cite{chen_fuzzy_2024}}\label{subsec:PseU-FKeERF}
      This study utilized fuzzy kernel evidence Random Forest (FKeERF) with several RNA sequence encoding schemes to identify pseudouridine sites.
      Fuzzy logic was used to expand the feature space, and feature selection was performed through fuzzy mean clustering and Gaussian fuzzy membership.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Feature Encoding}: Binary, PSTNPss, NCP, PseKNC
        \item \textbf{Feature Selection}: Fuzzy mean clustering and Gaussian fuzzy membership.
        \item \textbf{Model}: Fuzzy C-mean, Evidential Random Forest, cross-validation and independent tests.
      \end{itemize}
